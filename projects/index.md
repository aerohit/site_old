## Open Source Projects

### SimpleDBFluentQueries

  - [SimpleDBFluentQueries](https://github.com/aerohit/SimpleDBFluentQueries) is a fluent Java
    API for generating Amazon SimpleDB search queries. The library is inspired from Hibernate`s 
    criteria api.


## Summer Projects

### An algorithmic trading application, *Google Summer of Code 2008* 

  - Developed an algorithmic trading application to study the effect of latencies/delays in
    stock quotes on real time trading.
  - The application was developed on the [Ptolemy](http://ptolemy.eecs.berkeley.edu/) framework
    of EECS at UC Berkeley. 
  - The application was based on discrete model of computation in which actors with distributed
    responsibilities made trading decisions.
  - Implemented various trading strategies such as ETF arbitrage and moving averages and some
    heuristics for automated learning based on history for making trading requests.      
    

### Mesh moving schemes for Delaunay meshes, *CFD Lab, IIT Kanpur (2007)*

  - Implemented a mesh moving scheme in Fortran by using mathematical interpolation functions to
    study flows around moving objects.
